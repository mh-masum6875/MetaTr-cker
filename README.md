Nowadays due to the Corona outbreak, it is difficult to go to the gym for our regular workout with the restricted movement control order in place. 

Trainers and gym enthusiasts are in need to track their own workout regime, but the gym is off limits. Trainees are unable to customize their own training regime according to their preference and keep track of their physical fitness, BMI, calories burned as well as FFMI. Apps that are featured in the play store always come with in purchases for premium features which is inconvenient to some. 

The approach we came up with in regards to solving this issue is to create a dedicated fitness tracking app that is designed to track a user training regime and record their progress, session by session on a daily basis. This app will be user-friendly and completely free to use without any ads since it's a community service. The platform we’re using to market this app is via Google Play Store. The app will be created by using Java source code. 

Benefits of this app are, users can use this application to track their fitness progress and do exercises from the comfort of their own homes during this corona time. Trainers and trainees may use this app to keep track of their weight, fat, muscles, water limit, size, BMI, and FFMI and maintain track of their weight, fat, muscles, and water limit. Furthermore, they may monitor the growth of their biceps, chest, waist, hips, and both thighs at any time. 

Besides, this application is free of all forms of advertising and free of any cost makes it preferable to the community. To be honest, there seem to be many competitors for fitness related apps on the app store nowadays like Mission Lean, Peloton App, Obé, Apple Fitness+, OpenFit, Nike run Club, kakaFit, MyFitnessPal, and Sworkit. However, our app is totally FREE to use and community users can use the premium feature freely compared to other apps which require subscription to get the full access.





List the objectives as in the proposal. Organize into two to three paragraphs.

Covid-19 pandemic has changed the world regulations to a certain degree. Previously, day-to-day activities were done face to face. Now, virtual meetups becoming work platforms. Majority prefer online sessions since it does not require physical interactions. Moreover, alert notifications are sent instantly for any kind of subscriptions. Community applications are becoming vital. Current global conditions are such due to poor Health & Well-Being concerns among the community. We should follow a proper diet and exercise regularly. 

To ensure their employees are healthy and fit, certain company organizations have stepped up on another level by giving out exercise regimes to each employee and overviewing their progress online meets. Nike, Johor Premium Outlets (JPO) has been implementing this structure to their work system. The system is partially successful, since employee records are not kept/saved on a database for reference. Employees are just updating their upper line/leaders upon daily regime completion via in-call messages and it seems the data is not recorded because they are not getting paid for the task. This is an off-job scope task and to be honest the reality is as such. We get paid for the work we do and monitoring employee fitness records is not part of the job scope for such an organization. As responsible individuals we should have self-consciousness to take care of our own health and fitness. 

Hence, AD-Tech Co. had planned to provide assistance by promoting efficiency to the idea, which is a fitness app development. Java Language application development technology is used in terms of technical feasibility Implement application in several stages (agile method) as brainstorming, designing, development, quality assurance and deployment. 

Thus, the objective is to analyze requirement of stakeholders and target communities, then to design the requirements as proposed fitness tracking mobile application that keeps track of user’s stats followed by construction/ iteration, subsequently Testing/ Quality assurance before implementing to the community. 

Our development team consists of Software Engineers with Java Language skills, capable of related technical tasks. For economic feasibility, we should consider the general cost that is required for such a project, meaning lower the project cost yielding greater project feasibility. Proper analysis, designing and implementation is crucial to prevent errors, faults and flaws to occur since the architecture exclusively relies on such strong foundations
